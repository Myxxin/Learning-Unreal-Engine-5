### Introduction
[Unreal Sensei - Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zMkzmduqI)

This course provided a good introduction to the Unreal Engine UI and UX, to Lighting, Materials, Blueprints and Environment art.

I decided to abandon the environment and to skip the final details and the rendering. Though I managed to give the scenen a little bit of an identity with the sky and the lighting, it wasn't really my cup of tea, especially in terms of workflow. I however still learned a lot, especially regarding my plans going forward:

* I enjoy working with foliage and want to learn how to create realistic biomes
* I really enjoy lighting scenes with lumen
* I enjoy the Unreal engine UI
* I don't enjoy working with Kitbash assets such as the castle, I'd rather create finished assets in Blender.

Overall, I spent 15h on this introduction of which about 10h where spent on the final environment due to the very manual workflow.
